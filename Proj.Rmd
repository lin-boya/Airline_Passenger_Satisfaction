### Introduction
With the development of our modern society, we noticed that there is an increasing number of people exploring the world relying on airplanes, which effectively shortens the time and distance for journeys. However, we still hear a lot of negative feedback about the ride experience such as complaints about flight delays, terrible food, or in-flight services. In our project, we are going to explore the factors that influence passenger satisfaction in both positive and negative ways.    

To achieve this goal, we will use the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset to analyze the correlation between passenger satisfaction and possible factors. We will sort each factor into different ranking levels, then look at the impact of ease of booking, cabin class, and flight distance which are decided before boarding. We will see whether the customer type and the cabin class can raise satisfaction effectively or their impact can be  countervailed by short flight distance. Furthermore, we will examine the influence that the existence of delay, comfort, and cleanliness of the environment, quality of food, and inflight entertainment have on the satisfaction of passengers during the flight. The conclusions reached at the end of the project can be used to predict the choice of the airline companies that customers will make during planning the journey and help airline companies improve the service and passengersâ€™ experience.

Find the number of customers who are satisfied with the flights and who are netural or dissatisfied with the flights, the draw a bar plot, we can see from the plot, the number of customers who are satisfied with the flights is larger than the number of customers who are dissatisfied with the flights.

```{r}
ggplot(data=sat, aes(x=satisfaction_v2)) + geom_bar(fill="orange") +
  labs(x="Satisfaction", y="Count", title="Count of satisfied or dissatisfied") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=sat, aes(x=departure_delay_in_minutes)) + geom_histogram(bins=30, fill="steelblue") +
  labs(x="Departure delay in minutes", title="Histogram of departure delay in minutes") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Calculate the proporation of satisfaction rate by gender, the proporation of female customers who are satisfied with the flight is higher than the proporation of male customers who are satisfied with the flight. The proporation of female customers who are satisfied with the flight is about 60%, the proporation of male customers who are satisfied with the flight is about 40%.
```{r}
sat %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarise(percent=mean(satisfaction_v2=="satisfied")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gender, y=percent)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue") +
  labs(y="Satisfaction Rate", x="Gender", title="Satisfaction rate by gender") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Calculate the proporation of satisfaction rate by customer type, the proporation of loyal customers who are satisfied with the flight is higher than the proporation of disloyal customers who are satisfied with the flight. The proporation of loyal customers who are satisfied with the flight is about 62%, the proporation of disloyal customers who are satisfied with the flight is about 24%.

```{r}
sat %>% group_by(customer_type) %>% summarise(percent=mean(satisfaction_v2=="satisfied")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=customer_type, y=percent)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue") +

### Modeling
Split the data into training dataset and test dataset. Separating data into training and testing sets is an important part of evaluating data mining models. Typically, when we separate a data set into a training set and testing set, most of the data is used for training, and a smaller portion of the data is used for testing. Analysis Services randomly samples the data to help ensure that the testing and training sets are similar. By using similar data for training and testing, we can minimize the effects of data discrepancies and better understand the characteristics of the model. Here we will plit randomly this data set into 70% train and 30% test.
After spliting, there are 90640 observations in the train dataset, and 38847 observations in the test dataset.
```{r echo=F}
train_index <- sample(1:nrow(sat), nrow(sat)*0.7)
train <- sat[train_index, ]
test <- sat[-train_index, ]
dim(train)
dim(test)
```

#### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables. Here the satisfacton contains only two unique value, so we can apply logistic here, use the satisfacton as the response variable, and all other variables except ID as the predictors.

```{r}
glm.mod <- glm(satisfaction_v2~., train[, -1], family = binomial)
summary(glm.mod)
probs <- predict(glm.mod, test, type="response")
preds <- ifelse(probs>0.5, "satisfied", "neutral or dissatisfied")
mean(preds==test$satisfaction_v2)
```

All the p-value of the predictors is less than 0.05, so all the predictors are significant, the positive coefficient means that the predictor will increase the probablity of satisfaction, the negative coefficeint means that the predictor will decrease the probability of satisfaction, the auccuray of the model is 0.836.

#### KNN
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique.  K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses 'feature similarity' to predict the values of new datapoints which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based on how closely it matches the points in the training set. 

Here will use all available numeric variables, apply a KNN model with k=2 to predict the satisfaction of the customers.
```{r}
library(class)
train.x <- as.matrix(train[, -c(1:7)])
test.x <- as.matrix(test[, -c(1:7)])
# k = 2
preds <- knn(train.x, test.x, train$satisfaction_v2, k=2)
cm <- table(preds, test$satisfaction_v2)
mean(preds==test$satisfaction_v2)
```

The accuray of the KNN(k=2) is 0.716.


#### LDA

Discriminant analysis is used to predict the probability of belonging to a given class (or category) based on one or multiple predictor variables. It works with continuous and/or categorical predictor variables.

Compared to logistic regression, the discriminant analysis is more suitable for predicting the category of an observation in the situation where the outcome variable contains more than two classes. Additionally, itâ€™s more stable than the logistic regression for multi-class classification problems.

The LDA algorithm starts by finding directions that maximize the separation between classes, then use these directions to predict the class of individuals. These directions, called linear discriminants, are a linear combinations of predictor variables.

LDA assumes that predictors are normally distributed (Gaussian distribution) and that the different classes have class-specific means and equal variance/covariance.
```{r}
library(MASS)
lda.mod <- lda(satisfaction_v2~., train[, -1])
lda.mod
plot(lda.mod)
lda.pred <- predict(lda.mod, test)
mean(lda.pred$class==test$satisfaction_v2)
```

The accuray of the model is 0.837.


### Conclusion
Based on the computation above, we can found that the LDA model has the highest accuray rate, so the LDA model is the best classification model among the three models. The accuray is 0.837, it is moderate strong.
