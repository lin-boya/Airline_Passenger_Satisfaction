# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction

With the development of our modern society, we can notice that there is an increasing number of people exploring the world relying on airplanes, which effectively shortens the time and distance for journeys. However, we still hear a lot of negative feedback about the ride experience such as complaints about flight delays, terrible food, or in-flight services. This project will explore the factors that influence passenger satisfaction in both positive
and negative ways.

To achieve this goal, the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset will be used to analyze the correlation between passenger satisfaction and possible factors. Each factor will be sorted into different ranking levels, then we'll take a look at the impact of ease of booking, cabin class, and flight distance which are decided before boarding. We will see whether the customer type and the cabin class can raise satisfaction effectively or their impact can be countervailed by short flight distance. Furthermore, we will examine the influence that the existence of delay, comfort, and cleanliness of the environment, quality of food, and inflight entertainment have on the satisfaction of passengers during the flight.

The conclusions reached at the end of the project can be used to predict the choice of the airline companies that customers will make during planning the journey and help airline companies improve the service and passengersâ€™ experience.
